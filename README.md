# NoNameTowerDefense
A tower defense demo I made to one of my old programming team, back to when I was still in China. This is very similar to Kingdom Rush, so if you have played it, hopefully you can make some connections of some strategies, graphics, and controls with it ;)

Latest Release: 2017.12 :/

This game was developed using Adobe Flash, and I drew all of the graphical elements by myself using the software.

Here are some screeshots for a taste of the game-play:
